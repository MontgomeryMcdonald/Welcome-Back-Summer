            <h1>My Summer</h1>
            <p>My summer, overall, was a wonderful experience. I spent many days playing games, working on projects in games, and relaxing. I was extraordinarily tired at the end of last year, and it was a break i sorely needed.</p>

                <h2>Highlight Reel</h2>
                My summer was great. i relaxed, played minecraft with friends, learnt new skills, and worked to pursue further education. Im excited and refreshed for my final year of highschool, and ready to make it the best it can be.
